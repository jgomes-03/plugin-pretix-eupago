# Implementation Summary: EuPago Plugin v2 - New Payment Methods

## âœ… Implementation Completed

I have successfully implemented the new payment methods for the EuPago plugin as requested. Here's what was done:

## ðŸ”„ Changes Made

### 1. **Legacy Method Updated**
- Changed `EuPagoPayByLink` verbose name from "Pagamento Online" to **"Pagamento Online (Legacy)"**
- This method continues to use the default API key and webhook secret

### 2. **New Payment Methods Created**

#### A) **MB and Credit Card (EuPago)** - `eupago_mb_creditcard`
- **Functionality**: Combined MB (Multibanco) and Credit Card payment method
- **API**: Uses EuPago's PayByLink endpoint (`/api/v1.02/paybylink/create`)
- **Dedicated Settings**:
  - `mb_creditcard_api_key` - Dedicated API key
  - `mb_creditcard_webhook_secret` - Dedicated webhook secret
  - `mb_creditcard_description` - Custom description
- **Templates**: 
  - `checkout_payment_form_mb_creditcard.html`
  - `checkout_payment_confirm_mb_creditcard.html`

#### B) **MBWay (EuPago) - New Implementation** - `eupago_mbway_new`
- **Functionality**: MBWay payment with phone number input
- **API**: Uses EuPago's MBWay endpoint (`/api/v1.02/mbway/create`)
- **Dedicated Settings**:
  - `mbway_new_api_key` - Dedicated API key
  - `mbway_new_webhook_secret` - Dedicated webhook secret
  - `mbway_new_description` - Custom description
- **Templates**: 
  - `checkout_payment_confirm_mbway_new.html`

### 3. **Technical Implementation**

#### Settings Management (`payment.py`)
- Enhanced `get_setting()` method to support method-specific settings
- New payment classes inherit from `EuPagoBaseProvider`
- Method-specific prefix system (`method_prefix`) for configuration isolation
- Override `_get_headers()` and `_validate_webhook_signature()` for dedicated credentials

#### Webhook Handling (`views.py`)
- Added helper functions:
  - `_get_webhook_secret_for_decryption()` - For encrypted webhook decryption
  - `_get_webhook_secret_for_payment()` - For payment-specific signature validation
- Enhanced webhook processing to detect payment provider and use appropriate secrets
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing webhook handling

#### Settings Configuration (`settings.py`)
- Added organizer-level settings for new payment methods
- Proper form field definitions with help texts
- SecretKeySettingsField for secure credential storage

#### Plugin Registration (`signals.py`)
- Updated payment provider registration to include new methods
- Ordered providers with new methods first, legacy methods after

#### Configuration (`config.py`)
- Extended `PAYMENT_METHODS` mapping for new identifiers
- Added new method settings to `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`

### 4. **User Interface**

#### Templates Created
- **MB/Credit Card Form**: Explains payment options (MB and Credit Cards)
- **MB/Credit Card Confirm**: Shows redirect information and security warnings
- **MBWay New Confirm**: Shows waiting status with auto-refresh for payment confirmation

#### User Experience
- Clear indication of payment options for each method
- Proper status updates and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design maintained

### 5. **Security Features**

#### Method-Specific Credentials
- Each new payment method has its own API key and webhook secret
- Signature validation uses the correct secret for each payment type
- Fallback to default credentials for legacy methods

#### Webhook Security
- Enhanced signature validation per payment method
- Support for encrypted webhook decryption with multiple secrets
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 6. **Documentation**

#### Files Created
- `NEW_PAYMENT_METHODS.md` - Complete technical documentation
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step migration instructions
- Updated `README.md` with new features overview

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### For Organizers
1. **Configure dedicated credentials** for each new payment method in organizer settings
2. **Enable desired payment methods** in event payment settings
3. **Legacy methods continue working** with existing configuration

### For Customers
1. **MB and Credit Card**: Redirected to EuPago page with MB and Credit Card options
2. **MBWay New**: Enter phone number, receive MBWay push notification
3. **Improved UI**: Clearer payment method descriptions and status updates

### For Webhooks
1. **Automatic detection**: System identifies which payment method was used
2. **Correct validation**: Uses appropriate webhook secret for signature verification
3. **Seamless processing**: Payment confirmations work across all methods

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Required

### 1. **EuPago Side**
- Obtain separate API keys for:
  - MB and Credit Card payments
  - MBWay payments
- Configure webhook endpoints for each payment type

### 2. **Pretix Side**
- Configure new payment method credentials in organizer settings
- Enable new payment methods in event settings
- Test with sandbox before going live

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible**
- Existing "Pagamento Online (Legacy)" continues to work
- All legacy payment methods unchanged
- No disruption to current operations
- Gradual migration possible

## ðŸ“Š Benefits Delivered

1. **Better Organization**: Separate credentials per payment type
2. **Enhanced Security**: Dedicated webhook secrets
3. **Improved Monitoring**: Easier to track specific payment methods
4. **Future-Proof**: Extensible architecture for additional methods
5. **User Experience**: Clearer payment options and better descriptions

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** in your development environment
2. **Obtain new API credentials** from EuPago for each payment method
3. **Configure the new payment methods** in Pretix organizer settings
4. **Test payment flows** with sandbox credentials
5. **Deploy to production** when ready

The implementation follows EuPago documentation (https://eupago.readme.io) and maintains full compatibility with existing functionality while providing the requested new features.
